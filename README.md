# elegantcv

A simple and elegant Curriculum Vitae. Works nice with LaTeX and XeTeX. (haven't tried with LuaTex).

# To use

Put the `elegantcv.cls` and `icons` dir at same dir as your curriculum. Use `example-cv.tex` as an
example.

# To build the example

```
pdflatex example-cv.tex
```

And it will build the pdf file.

# Bugs

A few. 

1. URL params not working inside \href

2. Not able to remove dashes from phone.

# Todo

A lot.
